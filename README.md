# TCPTorConnect
A simple Python script for connecting remotely to TOR network and onion sites.

# Setup
First clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Polskiecus/TCPTorConnect/`
Then Optionally(tough very recommended) start by setting up Control Port password(can be done
using 'tor --hash-password "passwd"' and editing torrc(in this case inside the Components Directory
by adding a line like so: 'HashedControlPassword YOURHASHHERE', you will get warned if you dont do this.
The last thing I recommend doing is recompiling/getting tor binary by yourself(not needed, but highly recommended)
and placing it under the path Components/Binaries/tor

# Usage
The program does not have a wiki yet, but all the functionality you may need is put in an example inside it :)

# Support
As its GNU/GPL project I will try to resolve issues, but I wont promise anything(this program does not come with any 
law applicable warranty), aside from that it should be working on all platforms, but I am only going to maintain it 
for LINUX based operating systems
